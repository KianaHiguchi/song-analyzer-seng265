# Song Analyzer — SENG 265

This repository contains a command-line **Song Analyzer** project developed as part of **SENG 265 (Software Development Methods)** at the University of Victoria.
The project uses mainly C, but also Python for one implementation

## Repository Structure
- **assignment1_c/**
Introductory C implementation focused on core C fundamentals such as structs, arrays, file I/O, and string parsing.
- **assignment2_python/**
Python implementation using object-oriented design, argparse for command-line interfaces, and CSV data processing 
- **assignment3_c_pipeline/**
Advanced C implementation using linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, merge sort, modular source files, and Makefile

## Assignment Features
- Parses large CSV files containing song metadata using file I/O
- Supports filtering and sorting of records based on specified fields
- Implements custom data structures (structs, linked lists) for storage
- Uses merge sort for efficient ordering of song records
- Handles dynamic memory allocation with proper cleanup
- Modular design with separated source files and Makefile-based builds
- Command-line interface with argument parsing for flexible execution
- Implementation in both C and Python


## Notes
This repository is intended as a portfolio reference to demonstrate coursework and programming fundamentals.
